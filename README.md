# CS50

Is Harvard's "Intro to Computer Science" course, free for anyone interested in the topic. It covers many foundational topics, such as basic programming concepts, memory management, algorithms etc.

## Motivation

As a self-taught programmer, I often feel like my understanding is lacking. I wanted to dive deeper in low level concepts, and CS50 seemed like the most appropriate way. I also wanted to familiarize myself with basic C programming.

In the future I strive to become well-versed professional, who understands what he is doing thoroughly. In this repository, I am going to upload my solutions to this course's problem sets.
